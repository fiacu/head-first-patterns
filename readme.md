Back to school
==============

Arme este proyecto para poner en practica algunos conceptos que tenia en deshuso.

OO Basics
---------
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

OO Principles
-------------
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composite over inheritance
- Program to interface, no implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.
- Classes should be opened to extension but closed to modification.
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.

OO Patters
----------
- Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes then interchangeable. Strategy let the algorithms vary independently from client that use it. ** Ducks **
- Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object change state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- Decorator: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending  functionality.
- Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.
- Singleton: Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- Command: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different request, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- Adapter: Converts an interface of a class into another interface the client expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
